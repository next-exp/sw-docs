Dorothea
========

*From ancient Greek, Δωροθέα: gift of God.*

The purpose of *Dorothea* is to process the **PMaps** (output of *Irene*) and
reconstruct point-like events. Therefore, all the information included in the S2 peaks
is collapsed into a single x, y, z point with summarized S1 and S2 properties.
Additionally, some parameters regarding the S1 and S2 peaks are provided as a tool for further selections.
Last, it is worth noting that for events where more than one S1 or S2 (or both) are
present in the event, a point is reconstructed for each possible combination.


.. _Dorothea input:

Input
-----

* ``/Run/events``
* ``/Run/runInfo``
* ``/PMAPS/S1``
* ``/PMAPS/S1Pmt``
* ``/PMAPS/S2``
* ``/PMAPS/S2Pmt``
* ``/PMAPS/S2Si``

.. _Dorothea output:

Output
------

 * ``/DST/Events``: summary of the reconstructed events and their main properties. Each row represents one combination of an S1 and a S2 identified under the same ``event`` but with its corresponding  ``s1_peak`` and ``s2_peak`` identifier. The full list and description of the parameters in the table can be found :ref:`here  <output>`.
 * ``/Filters/s12_selector``: flag for whether an event passed the S1 and S2 selections


.. _Dorothea config:

Config
------

Besides the :ref:`Common arguments to every city`, *Dorothea* has the following arguments:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 40 120
   :header-rows: 1

   * - **Parameter**
     - **Type**
     - **Description**

   * - ``drift_v``
     - ``float``
     - Drift velocity of the secondary electrons towards the anode.

   * - ``s1|s2_nmin|nmax``
     - ``int``
     - Lower/upper limits to the number of S1/S2 peaks per event.

   * - ``s1|s2_emin|emax``
     - ``float``
     - Lower/upper limits to the energy (integral under the peak) of each S1/S2 peak (pes).

   * - ``s1|s2_wmin|wmax``
     - ``float``
     - Lower/upper limits to the width (time over threshold) of each S1/S2 peak.

   * - ``s1|s2_hmin|hmax``
     - ``float``
     - Lower/upper limits to the height (maximum amplitude) of each S1/S2 peak (pes).

   * - ``s1|s2_ethr``
     - ``float``
     - Threshold for each bin within each S1/S2 to be considered for the energy computation (pes).

   * - ``s2_nsipmmin|nsipmmax``
     - ``int``
     - Lower/upper limits to the number of SiPM sensors with a recorded signal.

   * - ``global_reco_params``
     - ``dict``
     - Set of parameters for the corona algorithm. Since the desired one is the barycenter reconstruction, the only required elements in the dictionary are:

        * ``Qthr``: time-integrated charge threshold, ignore all SiPMs with less than Qthr pes.
        * ``lm_radius=-1``: sets the algorithm to be the barycenter.


.. _Dorothea workflow:

Workflow
--------

The workflow for *Dorothea* starts with a filter that removes the peaks not satisfying the limits provided via configuration file. The event is selected if and only if the number of remaining peaks falls in the range [s1_nmin, s1_nmax] and [s2_nmin, s2_nmax]. Then, it proceeds to perform the point-like reconstruction. This algorithm collapses the whole S2 information into a single point, which has summarized information about S1 and S2, such as:

 * The *x* and *y* position are determined via a charge-weighted average (a.k.a. center of gravity or barycenter). This makes use of the so-called ``corona`` `algorithm <https://github.com/next-exp/IC/blob/8be75c65aa2e452eae4ce2e51494a58eab18a0d4/invisible_cities/reco/xy_algorithms.py#L61>`_, with the proper configuration to apply the barycenter computation.
 * The *z* coordinate is derived from the time difference between the maximum amplitude of the S1 and S2 considered, corrected by the drift velocity.
 * The energy is the integral under the PMT S2 peak using the bins above the threshold.
 * The charge is the integral under the SiPM S2 peak. A previous threshold has already been applied in the Irene city.

 As a final remark, notice that the peak height, width, time and energy come from the PMTs, while the charge (S2q) and the xy position come from the SiPMs.
